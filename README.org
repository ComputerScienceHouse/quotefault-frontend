* Quotefault v2
** What is Quotefault?
[[https://quotefault.csh.rit.edu][Quotefault]] is a Quote Database for out-of-context quotes spoken by members of
[[https://csh.rit.edu][Computer Science House]].
** Why is v2?
[[https://github.com/ComputerScienceHouse/Quotefault/][Original Quotefault]] was written by [[https://github.com/dantayy][user:dantayy]] in (supposedly) one weekend. It
was a great piece of software, but it was decided that it must be rewritten to
support a more modern client-server architecture, instead of the template format
it used previously.
** What is v2?
Features added:
1. Multi-user quotes
2. Infinite scrolling (finally)
3. Search
4. More Search (!)
5. Report reasons
** How is Quotefault v2?
*** Frontend
The Quotefault frontend is a React web app using Typescript.
Other technologies used:
- ~vite~ :: Build system. Very fast :)
- ~eslint~ :: Linter, used to make sure code is good quality
- ~prettier~ :: Standardizes the code format
- ~docker~ :: For deployment on CSH's Kubernetes cluster
- ~nginx~ :: Used in the Docker build process, for VERY fast hosting

*** Backend

* Dev Setup
1. Make sure you have ~npm~ installed
2. Run ~npm ci~ to download dependancies
   1. This should automatically configure the ~git~ hooks, but check your ~git~
      config (~git config -l~) to make sure ~core.hookspath~ is set to
      ~git-hooks~
3. To run the app, run ~npm run dev~
